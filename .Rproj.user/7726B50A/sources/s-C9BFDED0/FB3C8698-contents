\title{Calculate the Core Fitness genes using the  90th-percentile least dependent cell line from the scaled Bayesian Factor matrix}
\usage{
ADAM.broadCF(depMat,
             display=TRUE,
             percentile=0.9,
             prefix='BroadPercentileMethod')
}
\arguments{
\item{depMat}{Scaled Binary Factor dependency matrix, rows are genes and columns are samples. A real number in position \emph{[i,j]} indicates the bayesian factor that indicates if the inactivation of the \emph{i}-th gene exerts a significant loss of fitness in the \emph{j}-th sample. Higher the bayesian factor indicates higher probability of beign a core fitness gene.}

\item{display}{Boolean, default is TRUE. Should bar plots of the dependency profiles be plotted}

\item{percentile}{percentage of the cell lines where the given gene should show depletion. The default value is 0.9 indicating least dependent 90th percentile cell line.}

\item{prefix}{if the display is false the plots are generated in the working directory using the prefix.}

A vector that containing the Core Fitness Genes:
}
\description{
This function identifies the Core Fitness genes from a given the scaled Bayesian Factor matrix where each row is gene and each column the cell line. The function uses all the cell lines and identifies the genes that are essential in majority of the cell lines.
}
\details{
This function implements the idea that if a gene is essential then it should fall in the top Z most depleted genes in at least 90% of cell lines. Here the threshold Z is calculated in a data driven way.
For a given gene, we can rank its gene effect score in each cell line, then arrange cell lines in order of increasing gene effect score for that gene. This creates a bimodal distribution of gene ranks in their 90th-percentile least depleted lines.
Z is choosen as the minimum density between the two gaussian distributions that are estimated from these ranks. All genes with rank less than this threshold in their 90th percentile cell lines are reported
